## Project Purposes
This project allows me to investigate storing and working with encrypted data in a mobile environment.  It contains various simple applications, such as notes, projects, and even images.  The project utilizes RxJava to allow for asynchronous encryption and decryption of data.  It also makes use of simple MVP design patterns to allow me to create re-usable and testable software components.

Below you will find general designs as well as additional details on interesting areas of this codebase.
