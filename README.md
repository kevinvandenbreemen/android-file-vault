## Project Purposes
This project allows me to investigate storing and working with encrypted data in a mobile environment.  It contains various simple demonstration applications, such as notes, projects, and a camera app.  The project utilizes RxJava to allow for asynchronous encryption and decryption of data.  It also makes use of simple MVP design patterns to allow me to create re-usable and testable software components.

Below you will find general designs as well as additional details on interesting areas of this codebase.
